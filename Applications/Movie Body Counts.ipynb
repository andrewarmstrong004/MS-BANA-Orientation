    "## About the data source\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie Body Counts is a forum where users collect on-screen body counts for a selection of films and the characters and actors who appear in these films. The dataset currently contains counts for 545 films from 1949 to 2013, which is a very small sample of all the films produced in this time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be counted a kill and/or dead body has to be visible on the screen, implied deaths like those died in the explosion of the Death Star are not counted. For more details on how counts should be conducted see [their guidelines](http://moviebodycounts.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=general&action=display&thread=6), the first one reads:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The \"body counts\" for this site are mostly \"on screen kills/deaths\" or fatal/critical/mortal shots/hits of human, humanoid, or creatures (ie monsters, aliens, zombies.) The rule of thumb is \"do they bleed\" which will leave the concept of cyborgs somewhat open and decided per film. The human and creature counts should be separate. These will be added together for a final tally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the small number of films in this dataset, we can safely assume a [selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias). So take this exploration with a grain of salt and don't generalize any of the results. This is mainly a demonstration of some of things you can to with the tools being used and a fun dataset to look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [CSV dataset](http://figshare.com/articles/On_screen_movie_kill_counts_for_hundreds_of_films/889719) is kindly provided by [Randal Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/) ([@randal_olson](https://twitter.com/randal_olson)), who took the effort of collecting the death toll data from Movie Body Counts and added MPAA and IMDB ratings as well as film lengths."
